• Introduced second company with Hanover as their underwriter.
• This is a broad market play and does NOT require a BriteCo appraisal in the process, however it does require an appraisal within the last 3 years.
• Portions of our PA product - very segmented – Used JM Specialty as their base includes Credit in rating.
• Very similar quote flow as JM - like their breakdown of payments as a monthly option. Looks to be geared for a mobile phone application.
• BriteCo is receiving tiered commissions from Hanover
- 50% up to $2M then drops to 20—25%
- Profit sharing once program reaches $12M with a target of 50% LR - pays up to 2.5% more in commission
• No Call Center - All questions via email/chat.
• Claim over 2100+ jewelers in appraisal software<a href=""https://brite.co/"">BriteCo Website</a></p>",

Photography / Video Service - Zing Studio,Accelerate,Professional Services,TRUE,"<p>
Situation: 
There is a great deal of enthusiasm around Zing Studio from JCK. All types of Retail Jewelry Ecosystem have recognized the superior output of Zing Studios. We are in the process of securing clients like Facets of Fire, RDI Diamonds and will continue to enroll as many customers as possible. We are at a pivotal moment, as quality imagery is critical for B2B as tradeshow costs and travel become more expensive to attend in person.
<br></br>
Processes are very manual currently - The July launch will provide relief in identifying, paying for, and coordinating shipping of the Jewelry to and from the studio.
<br></br>
Obstacles: What, if any obstacles, challenges have you faced or are facing?
1)	Customers expect us to upload imagery to ZING and clients can view and download their photos and videos all in one spot when they log into Zing (Much like iCloud and Google Photos). Two scheduled appointments at JCK stated that I should give them a call when this functionality is available all in one place, as they were not interested in USB or Google Drives. 
2)	Staffing and Training of other Photographers. There will be a learning curve for any additional staff added to support studio, which will initially slow our throughput. Any illness or time away from the office has a ripple effect. 
3)	Equipment for operating additional light boxes. We are at a single point of failure for our Specialized cameras and computers.
<br></br>
Actions: What actions have you or your team taken?  
We have continued to work with potential customers to hone in on their expectations from the service. The development team is working to automate processes to nitigate  risks inherent to manual processes.
<br></br>
Results: Have clients such as Erica Courtney & Kimberly Collins (President of AGTA).
